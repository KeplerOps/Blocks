# Rust Algorithm Ecosystem â€“ Comprehensive Requirements (Refactored)

This **Requirements Specification** covers a **Rust-based ecosystem** of crates offering a wide range of algorithms, primitives, and data structures. The project is treated as though it were **safety-critical**, emphasizing rigorous code quality, performance, interoperability, and robust documentation/testing. The ecosystem is designed to **empower developers** by providing **high-quality, reusable, and composable building blocks**, aiming to eliminate redundant implementations and facilitate the development of robust and efficient software, including **AI-driven systems**. The following sections incorporate **all previously stated requirements** plus **newly added items** from our discussions, **without omitting** anything from prior versions.

## 1. Functional Requirements (FR)

### 1.1 Architecture & Organization

- **FR1.1.1** The system **SHALL** be organized as a **Cargo workspace** with multiple crates under a `crates/` directory, grouped into four primary domains:

#### 1.6.6 Standardized Testing Patterns

- **FR1.6.6** All crates **SHALL** organize tests into:

- `src/` for core implementations,

- `fuzz/` for fuzz targets (if applicable).

#### 1.6.7 Shared Test Data

- **FR1.6.7** Shared or large test data sets **SHALL** be placed in a dedicated `testdata/` directory at the workspace root when multiple crates need consistent reference inputs.

#### 1.6.8 Security Hardening in Tests

    ```

- **FR1.7.3** **Unsafe code** usage or reliance on "core library unsafe" internals **SHALL** be explicitly noted with clear rationale in comments.

### 1.9 Cross-Cutting Concern: Errors & Logging

- **FR1.9.1** **Errors** across all crates **SHALL** use a **shared error model**, typically `Result<T, E>` with an enum-based `E`.

  - Mathematics: Numerical stability/accuracy
  - Statistics: Statistical power/confidence
  - ML: Model accuracy/convergence
- **FR1.10.3** The workspace **SHALL** provide a mechanism for sharing common build scripts or utilities across crates, minimizing redundancy in build processes.
- **FR1.10.4** The workspace **SHALL** have a defined process for managing cross-crate dependencies and ensuring compatibility between different versions of crates within the ecosystem.
- **FR1.10.5** All crates **SHALL** be organized under a `crates/` directory at the workspace root, with subdirectories for each domain (`cs/`, `math/`, `stats/`, `ml/`) and shared components.

6. **Performance & Scalability:**
   - Benchmarks and HPC feature flags enable usage from small embedded devices (via `no_std`) up to large-scale HPC systems.

7. **Documentation for Humans and AI:**
   - Plain-language descriptions, pseudo-code, complexity analysis, and usage examples empower developers to quickly adopt and adapt algorithms. Consistent documentation patterns facilitate understanding and potential programmatic analysis.

8. **Formal Governance & Lifecycle:**
   - **Branch strategy**, **code reviews**, **semantic versioning**, and **deprecation policies** provide a professional structure that's typical for large-scale or safety-critical projects.

9. **Composable Architecture:**
    - Emphasize trait-based interfaces and clear API design to enable seamless integration and composition of different data structures and algorithms within the ecosystem.

10. **Curated High-Quality Components:**
    - Focus on providing a curated set of exceptionally well-implemented algorithms and data structures, prioritizing quality and reliability over simply maximizing the number of components.
