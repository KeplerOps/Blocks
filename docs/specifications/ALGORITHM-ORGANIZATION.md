## Cross-Domain Considerations

While crates are organized into specific domains, some algorithms naturally span multiple domains. This section outlines the criteria and best practices for managing such cross-domain algorithms.

### Placement Criteria

- **Primary Theoretical Foundation**: Determine the primary domain based on the core principles of the algorithm.
- **Main Use Cases**: Consider where the algorithm is predominantly applied.
- **Performance Characteristics**: Algorithms optimized for specific performance metrics may influence placement.
- **Documentation Clarity**: Clearly document cross-domain applications to aid discoverability.

### Inter-Domain Dependencies

- **Machine Learning Dependencies**: ML crates may depend on Computer Science primitives for data handling and optimization.
- **Statistical Foundations**: Statistical crates often rely on Mathematical primitives for accurate computations.
- **System-Level Concerns**: High-Performance Computing (HPC) and distributed algorithms remain within Computer Science but interact with other domains as needed.

## Adding New Algorithms

When incorporating new algorithms into the ecosystem, follow these guidelines to maintain consistency and clarity.

1. **Determine Primary Domain**:
    - Identify the main theoretical foundation and typical use cases to assign the appropriate domain.

2. **Assess Dependencies**:
    - Evaluate existing crates and minimal shared utilities the new crate will depend on to avoid duplication.

3. **Define Crate Boundaries**:
    - Ensure the new crate adheres to single responsibility principles, focusing solely on its designated domain.

4. **Implement Trait-Based Interfaces**:
    - Utilize shared traits from `algo-core` and domain-specific primitives to ensure composability and interoperability.

5. **Document Thoroughly**:
    - Provide comprehensive documentation, including plain-language descriptions, pseudocode, complexity analysis, and usage examples.

6. **Align with Feature Flags**:
    - Expose relevant Cargo feature flags to toggle optional capabilities without imposing unnecessary dependencies.

7. **Include Testing**:
    - Incorporate unit tests, integration tests, benchmarks, and, if applicable, fuzz tests to ensure robustness and performance.

## Naming Conventions

Consistent naming conventions enhance readability and discoverability across the ecosystem.

- **Crate Names**:
  - Prefix with `blocks-` followed by the primary domain and specific functionality.
  - Use descriptive, kebab-case names reflecting the primary function (e.g., `blocks-cs-sort`, `blocks-math-num`).

- **Module Names**:
  - Use snake_case within crates to maintain Rust idiomatic standards.
  - Reflect the functionality and maintain clarity (e.g., `quick_sort`, `adam_optimizer`).

- **Trait and Struct Names**:
  - Use PascalCase for traits and structs, ensuring names are clear and expressive (e.g., `Algorithm`, `WeightedGraph`).

## Documentation Standards

High-quality documentation is crucial for usability and maintainability.

- **Rustdoc Comments**:
  - Use idiomatic Rustdoc comments (`///`) for all public functions, structs, enums, and traits.
  - Include sections like `Overview`, `Examples`, `Parameters`, `Returns`, and `Errors`.

- **Plain-Language Descriptions**:
  - Provide accessible explanations of each algorithm’s purpose and common use cases.

- **Pseudocode in Comments**:
  - Include standardized pseudocode within comments to illustrate core algorithm steps.

- **Complexity Analysis**:
  - Document time and space complexity (best, worst, average cases) for each algorithm.

- **Consistent Documentation Structure**:
  - Maintain uniform sections across all modules, traits, and functions to facilitate ease of understanding.

## Dependency Management

Efficient dependency management ensures modularity and minimizes potential conflicts.

- **Minimal Shared Dependencies**:
  - Crates should primarily depend on `blocks-core` and their respective domain-specific core crates to avoid redundancy.

- **Cargo Feature Flags**:
  - Utilize feature flags to manage optional capabilities and dependencies, ensuring flexibility and performance optimization.

- **Inter-Crate Dependencies**:
  - Clearly define and document dependencies between crates to maintain clarity and prevent circular dependencies.

## Versioning and Compatibility

Adhering to semantic versioning maintains compatibility and predictability for users.

- **Semantic Versioning**:
  - Follow semantic versioning (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) to indicate breaking changes, new features, and patches.

- **API Stability**:
  - Ensure APIs remain stable across minor versions, introducing breaking changes only in major version increments.

- **Deprecation Policies**:
  - Mark deprecated features clearly in documentation and provide migration paths, adhering to the deprecation timeline specified in `REQUIREMENTS.md`.

## Examples

Providing practical examples aids developers in understanding and utilizing the crates effectively.

- **Usage Examples**:
  - Include example code snippets demonstrating common use cases and best practices within Rust’s documentation.

- **Integration Examples**:
  - Showcase how different crates can be composed to solve complex problems, emphasizing composability and interoperability.

## Guidelines for Maintaining Consistency

Consistency across the ecosystem fosters a seamless development experience and reduces onboarding friction.

- **Coding Standards**:
  - Adhere to Rust’s official style guidelines (`rustfmt`) and enforce linting rules (`Clippy`) to maintain code quality.

- **Documentation Practices**:
  - Follow standardized documentation structures and conventions to ensure uniformity and ease of navigation.

- **Testing Protocols**:
  - Implement consistent testing patterns across crates, including unit tests, integration tests, benchmarks, and fuzz tests where applicable.

- **Contribution Guidelines**:
  - Clearly outline contribution procedures, coding standards, and review processes to maintain high-quality code contributions and collaborative development.
