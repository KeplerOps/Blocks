# Workspace Feature Flag Strategy [DRAFT]

## Core Principles

1. **Verification First**
   - Features must not compromise provable safety
   - All feature combinations must be formally verified
   - Performance features require proof of non-interference

2. **API Stability**
   - Features cannot break public API contracts
   - Breaking changes require major version bump
   - Deprecated features must remain for one major version

3. **Minimal Surface Area**
   - Default builds include only verified core
   - Optional features must be explicitly enabled
   - Features compose through proven interfaces

## Standard Features

### Core Features

- `std`: Standard library support (default)
- `alloc`: Heap allocation support (default)
- `verified`: Additional runtime verification (default)
- `unsafe-performance`: Verified unsafe optimizations

### Safety Features

- `checked-math`: Verified arithmetic operations
- `bounds-checking`: Additional bounds verification
- `overflow-checks`: Integer overflow protection
- `memory-safety`: Additional memory verification

### Performance Features

Each requires formal proof of correctness:
- `simd`: SIMD with safety guarantees
- `parallel`: Verified concurrent algorithms
- `gpu`: Proven GPU acceleration
- `vectorization`: Auto-vectorization

### Domain Features

Format: `{domain}-{capability}`
Each requires domain-specific verification:

```rust
[features]
cs-parallel = ["parallel", "verified"]
math-simd = ["simd", "checked-math"]
```

## Feature Verification

### Safety Requirements

1. Core Invariants
   ```rust
   #[verified]
   pub trait SafetyInvariant {
       fn verify(&self) -> Proof;
   }
   ```

2. Feature Composition
   ```rust
   #[verify_feature(simd)]
   #[verify_feature(parallel)]
   pub fn optimized_sort<T: Verified>(data: &mut [T])
   ```

### Performance Verification

1. Bounds Checking
   ```rust
   #[performance_bound("O(n log n)")]
   #[verify_performance]
   pub fn parallel_sort<T>(data: &mut [T])
   ```

2. Resource Usage
   ```rust
   #[memory_bound("O(1)")]
   #[verify_memory]
   pub fn in_place_sort<T>(data: &mut [T])
   ```

## API Stability

### Version Rules

1. Feature Status:
   - `stable`: Verified, tested, documented
   - `beta`: Verified, under performance testing
   - `experimental`: Under verification

2. Breaking Changes:
   - Must be explicitly marked
   - Require major version bump
   - Need verification proof update

### Deprecation Process

1. Mark as deprecated:
   ```rust
   #[deprecated(since = "1.1.0", note = "Use verified_sort instead")]
   pub fn old_sort<T>(data: &mut [T])
   ```

2. Maintain for one major version
3. Remove with proof of non-impact

## Testing Requirements

1. Feature Matrix Testing
   ```rust
   #[test]
   #[verify_features(parallel, simd)]
   fn test_optimized_sort() 
   ```

2. Performance Regression
   ```rust
   #[bench]
   #[verify_performance]
   fn bench_parallel_sort()
   ```

## Documentation Requirements

Each feature requires:
- Formal verification status
- Performance implications
- Safety guarantees
- Migration guides

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Feature Guards:
   ```rust
   #[cfg(feature = "simd")]
   #[verify(safety = "proven")]
   mod simd_impl {
       // Implementation with proofs
   }
   ```

2. Safety Checks:
   ```rust
   #[cfg(feature = "checked-math")]
   #[verify(arithmetic = "safe")]
   fn checked_add(a: u32, b: u32) -> Option<u32>
   ```

## Continuous Integration

1. Feature Verification Matrix
2. Cross-feature testing
3. Performance regression checks
4. API stability verification
