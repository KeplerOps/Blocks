# Code Review Guidelines [DRAFT]

## Overview

These guidelines establish a code review process appropriate for safety-critical systems. They are currently in draft form as the project is in early development.

## Review Process

### Pre-Review Checklist

1. **Static Analysis**
   - All Clippy warnings addressed
   - Format check passed (`cargo fmt`)
   - Documentation coverage complete
   - Test coverage meets thresholds

2. **Safety Checks**
   - Memory safety verified
   - Error handling complete
   - Unsafe code justified
   - Panics documented

3. **Performance Verification**
   - Benchmarks run
   - No performance regressions
   - Resource usage analyzed
   - Complexity documented

### Review Focus Areas

1. **Correctness**
   - Algorithm implementation matches specification
   - Edge cases handled
   - Error conditions covered
   - Invariants maintained

2. **Safety**
   - Memory safety
   - Thread safety
   - Error propagation
   - Resource management

3. **Performance**
   - Algorithmic complexity
   - Memory usage
   - Cache behavior
   - Allocation patterns

4. **Maintainability**
   - Code clarity
   - Documentation quality
   - Test coverage
   - Interface design

### Review Comments

- Focus on technical substance
- Reference specific requirements or standards
- Provide concrete suggestions
- Link to relevant documentation

### Response Guidelines

- Address all safety concerns
- Explain complexity tradeoffs
- Document performance implications
- Update tests as needed

## Current Limitations

As the project is in early development:
- Single reviewer workflow
- Focus on core infrastructure
- Emphasis on design decisions
- Flexible on non-critical items

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements:
- Multi-reviewer process
- Automated safety checks
- Performance regression testing
- Security audit integration
