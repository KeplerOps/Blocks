# Blocks Documentation [DRAFT]

## Overview

Blocks is a Rust-based ecosystem of algorithms, data structures, and primitives designed with a safety-critical mindset. The project implements rigorous code quality, performance, interoperability, and robust documentation/testing standards suitable for safety-critical applications.

## Project Status

Currently implementing workspace-level infrastructure and core traits. Not ready for production use. All code is treated as potentially safety-critical.

## Safety-Critical Focus

- Comprehensive error handling
- Memory safety guarantees
- Formal verification where applicable
- Thorough testing and documentation

## Roadmap

1. Q1 2024: Workspace Infrastructure
   - Core trait definitions
   - Testing and verification framework
   - CI/CD pipeline with safety checks
   - Documentation standards

2. Q2 2024: Computer Science Domain
   - Core data structures with safety guarantees
   - Formally verified sorting algorithms
   - Memory-safe search implementations
   - Verified graph algorithms

## Version Control

All documentation is versioned alongside code. References between documents use relative paths and are checked in CI.

## Contributing

This project is in early development. See [Contributing](development/CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines. All contributions must meet safety-critical standards.
