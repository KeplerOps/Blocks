# ADR-0002: Verification Strategy [DRAFT]

**Status**: Proposed  
**Deciders**: Core Team  
**Date**: 2024-01-15  
**Safety Impact**: High

## Context

The Blocks ecosystem requires comprehensive verification to ensure correctness, safety, and performance characteristics. This strategy defines our approach to formal verification, testing, and proof generation.

Key drivers:
- Need for mathematical correctness guarantees
- Requirement for composable proofs
- Performance verification needs
- Safety-critical usage scenarios

## Safety-Critical Considerations

- Memory safety must be formally verified
- All unsafe code must have formal proofs
- Error handling must be provably complete
- Performance bounds must be verified
- Security properties must be proven

## Decision

Implement a layered verification strategy:

### 1. Core Verification (Lowest Level)
- Formal verification using Prusti
- Mathematical proofs of key properties
- Memory safety proofs
- Performance bounds verification
- Edge case verification

### 2. Domain-Specific Verification
- Interface contracts with Creusot
- Property-based testing with proof generation
- Domain-specific invariant verification
- Composition proofs between components

### 3. Integration Verification
- Cross-domain composition proofs
- Feature interaction verification
- System-wide invariant preservation
- Performance composition proofs

### Toolchain Selection

Primary Tools:
- Prusti: Core memory safety and functional correctness
- Creusot: Interface contracts and composition
- Kani: Verification of unsafe code blocks
- Proptest: Property-based testing with proof generation
- Klee: Performance verification

## Consequences

### Positive

- Mathematically proven correctness
- Composable safety guarantees
- Automated proof generation
- Verifiable performance bounds
- Edge case verification
### Negative

- Significant development overhead
- Complex proof maintenance
- Toolchain integration challenges
- Performance impact of verification

### Neutral

- Need for specialized expertise
- Increased documentation requirements
- Modified development workflow

## Compliance

- Safety: FR1.6.3 (Formal verification)
- Testing: FR1.6.1-1.6.8
- Documentation: FR1.5
- Feature Verification: FR1.4

## Verification Strategy

### Proof Requirements

1. Core Components:
   - Memory safety
   - Type safety
   - Resource management
   - Error propagation
   - Performance bounds

2. Algorithms:
   - Correctness proofs
   - Complexity bounds
   - Numerical stability
   - Resource usage

3. Features:
   - Interaction safety
   - Composition correctness
   - Performance impacts

### Continuous Verification

- Proof checking in CI pipeline
- Automated proof generation
- Regression testing of proofs
- Performance verification

## Alternatives Considered

### Testing-Only Approach

- Description: Rely on extensive testing without formal proofs
- Safety Impact: Insufficient for safety-critical use
- Performance: Lower verification overhead
- Rejected due to lack of mathematical guarantees

### Full Formal Methods

- Description: Formal proofs for all critical code
- Safety Impact: Highest guarantees
- Performance: Prohibitive overhead
- Rejected due to development impracticality
