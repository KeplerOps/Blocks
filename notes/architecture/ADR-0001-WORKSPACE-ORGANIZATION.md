# ADR-0001: Workspace Organization [DRAFT]

**Status**: Accepted  
**Deciders**: Core Team  
**Date**: 2024-01-15  
**Safety Impact**: High

## Context

The Blocks ecosystem requires an organizational structure that supports:
- Formal verification and mathematical proofs
- Safety-critical development practices
- Clear domain separation with proven boundaries
- Rigorous dependency management
- Comprehensive verification framework

Key drivers:
- Need for formal proofs of correctness
- Requirement for composable verified components
- Performance impact of verification overhead
- Testing and proof automation needs

## Decision

Implement a hierarchical workspace structure with verification:

```
blocks/
├── crates/
│   ├── core/           # Formally verified core
│   ├── cs/            # Computer science primitives
│   ├── math/          # Mathematical foundations
│   ├── stats/         # Statistical primitives
│   └── ml/            # Machine learning algorithms
├── proofs/            # Formal verification artifacts
├── docs/              # Documentation and specifications
└── verification/      # Verification infrastructure
```

Core design elements:
- Formally verified core traits in `blocks-core`
- Domain-specific verified cores (e.g., `blocks-cs-core`)
- Proof artifacts separated from implementation
- Standardized crate naming: `blocks-{domain}-{component}`

Safety boundaries:
- Formal verification of core components
- Proven composition rules between domains
- Mathematically verified error propagation
- Isolated verification environments

## Consequences

### Positive

- Mathematically proven correctness
- Verifiable dependency paths
- Automated proof generation
- Rigorous safety guarantees

### Negative

- Increased development complexity
- Verification overhead
- Higher documentation requirements
- Complex proof composition

### Neutral

- Need for proof automation tooling
- Regular verification audits
- Proof maintenance requirements

## Compliance

- Safety: Formal proofs of critical properties
- Performance: Verified performance bounds
- Testing: Proof-based test generation
- Documentation: Mathematical specifications

## Verification Strategy

### Core Components
- Full formal verification using Prusti/Creusot
- Mathematical proofs of key properties
- Automated proof generation where possible

### Domain-Specific Components
- Property-based testing with proof generation
- Formal interface verification
- Performance bounds verification

### Integration
- Composition proofs between domains
- Automated verification of feature interactions
- Continuous proof checking in CI

## Alternatives Considered

### Monolithic Repository

- Description: Single verified codebase
- Safety Impact: Harder to maintain proofs
- Performance: Verification overhead
- Rejected due to proof complexity

### Separate Repositories

- Description: Distributed verification
- Safety Impact: Complex proof composition
- Performance: Distributed verification overhead
- Rejected due to proof coordination complexity
