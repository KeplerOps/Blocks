## Development Notes

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each algorithm component
- Integration tests with real-world datasets
- Property-based testing for mathematical properties
- Target: 90%+ code coverage

### Implementation Principles
1. Type safety and compile-time guarantees
2. Generic implementations where possible
3. Clear error handling with custom error types
4. Comprehensive documentation with examples
5. Performance optimizations with benchmarks
6. SIMD acceleration where applicable

### Debug Notes & Progress Updates

#### Progress Updates

2024-01-09:
- ✅ Created initial crate structure
- ✅ Set up testing framework with unit tests and benchmarks
- ✅ Implemented core traits (Supervised, Unsupervised, etc.)
- ✅ Implemented k-means clustering with k-means++ initialization
- ✅ Added comprehensive test suite for k-means
