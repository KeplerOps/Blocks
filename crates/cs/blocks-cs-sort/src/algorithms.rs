This module provides a collection of sorting algorithms with different performance characteristics
and trade-offs. Each algorithm is implemented with a focus on performance, safety, and usability.

# Available Algorithms

## QuickSort
A divide-and-conquer algorithm that offers excellent average-case performance and in-place sorting.
- Average case: O(n log n)
- Worst case: O(nÂ²)
- Space: O(log n)
- Not stable
- In-place sorting

## HeapSort
A comparison-based algorithm using a binary heap data structure, offering consistent performance.
- Time: O(n log n) for all cases
- Space: O(1)
- Not stable
- In-place sorting

## MergeSort
A divide-and-conquer algorithm that guarantees stability and consistent performance.
- Time: O(n log n) for all cases
- Space: O(n)
- Stable
- Not in-place sorting

# Feature Flags
- `parallel`: Enables parallel sorting for large arrays
- `simd`: Enables SIMD optimizations for numeric types

# Examples
```rust
use blocks_cs_sort::algorithms::{quicksort, heapsort};

// Using QuickSort
let mut numbers = vec![3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9];
quicksort(&mut numbers);
assert_eq!(numbers, vec![1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9]);

// Using HeapSort
let mut numbers = vec![3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9];
heapsort(&mut numbers).expect("Sort should succeed");
assert_eq!(numbers, vec![1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9]);

// Using MergeSort
let mut numbers = vec![3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9];
mergesort(&mut numbers);
assert_eq!(numbers, vec![1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9]);
```
