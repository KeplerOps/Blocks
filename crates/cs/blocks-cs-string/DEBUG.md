# Debugging Session - blocks-cs-string

## Setup
- Running tests for blocks-cs-string crate
- Will track test failures and debugging progress here

## Test Results
5 test failures identified in suffix_automaton.rs:
1. test_basic_construction: Failing !sa.contains("nan")
2. test_case_sensitivity: Array mismatch [1 2 3] vs [1 3]
3. test_find_all: Array mismatch [1 2 3] vs [1 3]
4. test_long_text: Value mismatch 1000 vs 999
5. test_unicode_text: Array mismatch [2 3 4 5] vs [2]

## Analysis
1. contains() method issue:
   - Incorrectly accepting invalid substrings
   - Need to validate pattern length against state length

2. find_all() method issues:
   - Returning duplicate/incorrect positions
   - Position calculation may be incorrect
   - Deduplication logic may be failing

3. Position calculation:
   - Off-by-one error in position calculation
   - Need to verify boundary conditions

## Debug Log
1. Initial test run started...
2. Identified core issues in suffix automaton implementation
3. Planning fixes for contains() and find_all() methods
4. First attempt: Added matched_len and is_terminal checks - too restrictive
5. Second attempt: Simplified contains() and restored find_all() - still having issues

## Current Issues
1. contains() method:
   - Accepting invalid substrings (e.g. "nan" in "banana")
   - Need to validate pattern is a continuous substring

2. find_all() method:
   - Position calculation is off
   - Getting extra positions: [1 2 3] vs [1 3]
   - Need to ensure we only find valid, continuous matches

## Next Steps
1. Fix contains() to validate continuous substrings
2. Revise find_all() position calculation
3. Add validation in find_all() for continuous matches
